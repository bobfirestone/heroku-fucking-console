FUCK OFF.  You know what I fucking mean.  Just fucking do it.

**There needs to be more cursing in the command-line instead of at the command-line.**

After years of annoyance, I'm finally fucking fixing this once and for all.

## Installation

    $ heroku plugins:install https://github.com/tpope/heroku-fucking-console.git

## Usage

    $ heroku help fucking
    Additional commands, type "heroku help COMMAND" for more details:

      fucking:console  #  open a fucking console
      fucking:rake     #  execute a fucking rake task

These commands are aliased to be namespace-free.  That's the whole fucking
point.
